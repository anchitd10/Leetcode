// Problem-1353: Maximum Number of Events That Can Be Attended

// You are given an array of events where events[i] = [startDayi, endDayi]. Every event i starts at startDayi and ends at endDayi.
// You can attend an event i at any day d where startTimei <= d <= endTimei. You can only attend one event at any time d.
// Return the maximum number of events you can attend.
// Example:
// Input: events = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4]]
// Output: 3
// Explanation: You can attend all the three events.
// One way to attend them all is as shown.
// Attend the first event on day 1.
// Attend the second event on day 2.
// Attend the third event on day 3.
