// Problem-1267: Count Servers that Communicate

// You are given a map of a server center, represented as a m * n integer matrix grid, where 1 means that on that cell there is a server and 0 means that it is no server. Two servers are said to communicate if they are on the same row or on the same column.
// Return the number of servers that communicate with any other server.
// Example 1:
// Input: grid = [[1,0],[0,1]]
// Output: 0
// Explanation: No servers can communicate with others.

class Solution {
public:
    int countServers(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        vector<int> Rows(grid.size());
        vector<int> Col(grid[0].size());
        
        // row and column sums
        for (int i = 0; i < grid.size(); i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < grid[0].size(); j++) {
                Rows[i] += grid[i][j];
                Col[j] += grid[i][j];
            }
        }
        
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < grid.size(); i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < grid[0].size(); j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] == 1 && (Rows[i] > 1 || Col[j] > 1)) {
                    ans++;
                }
            }
