// Problem-3304: Find the K-th Character in String Game I

// Alice and Bob are playing a game. Initially, Alice has a string word = "a".

// You are given a positive integer k.
// Now Bob will ask Alice to perform the following operation forever:
// - Generate a new string by changing each character in word to its next character in the English alphabet, and append it to the original word.
// For example, performing the operation on "c" generates "cd" and performing the operation on "zb" generates "zbac".
// Return the value of the kth character in word, after enough operations have been done for word to have at least k characters.
// Note that the character 'z' can be changed to 'a' in the operation.
// Example 1:
// Input: k = 5
// Output: "b"
// Explanation:
// Initially, word = "a". We need to do the operation three times:
// Generated string is "b", word becomes "ab".
// Generated string is "bc", word becomes "abbc".
// Generated string is "bccd", word becomes "abbcbccd".

public:
    char kthCharacter(int k) {
        string sb = "a";
        while (sb.length() < k) {
            int size = sb.length();
            for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
                char nextChar = 'a' + ((sb[i] - 'a' + 1) % 26);
                sb += nextChar;
            }
        }
        return sb[k - 1];
    }
