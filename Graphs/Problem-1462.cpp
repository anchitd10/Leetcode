// Problem-1462: Course Schedule IV

// There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses - 1. You are given an array prerequisites where prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that you must take course ai first if you want to take course bi.
// For example, the pair [0, 1] indicates that you have to take course 0 before you can take course 1.
// Prerequisites can also be indirect. If course a is a prerequisite of course b, and course b is a prerequisite of course c, then course a is a prerequisite of course c.
// You are also given an array queries where queries[j] = [uj, vj]. For the jth query, you should answer whether course uj is a prerequisite of course vj or not.
// Return a boolean array answer, where answer[j] is the answer to the jth query.
// Example 1:
// Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]], queries = [[0,1],[1,0]]
// Output: [false,true]
// Explanation: The pair [1, 0] indicates that you have to take course 1 before you can take course 0.
// Course 0 is not a prerequisite of course 1, but the opposite is true.
