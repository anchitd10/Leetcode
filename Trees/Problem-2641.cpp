// Problem-2641: Cousin in Binary Tree II

// Given the root of a binary tree, replace the value of each node in the tree with the sum of all its cousins' values.
// Two nodes of a binary tree are cousins if they have the same depth with different parents.
// Return the root of the modified tree.
// Note that the depth of a node is the number of edges in the path from the root node to it.
// Example:
// Input: root = [5,4,9,1,10,null,7]
// Output: [0,0,0,7,7,null,11]
// Explanation: The diagram above shows the initial binary tree and the binary tree after changing the value of each node.
// - Node with value 5 does not have any cousins so its sum is 0.
// - Node with value 4 does not have any cousins so its sum is 0.
// - Node with value 9 does not have any cousins so its sum is 0.
// - Node with value 1 has a cousin with value 7 so its sum is 7.
// - Node with value 10 has a cousin with value 7 so its sum is 7.
// - Node with value 7 has cousins with values 1 and 10 so its sum is 11.
